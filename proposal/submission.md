One of the most promising use-cases of Urbit is the ability to store personal health data. There is a base layer of single-purpose health apps that can be built to store data, such as a person's weight, heart rate, temperature, activity, etc. Once created, Urbit's data sharing capabilities will allow additional apps to be built, giving a holistic view and providing new insights in a way that existing siloed apps cannot. Since we are so early in the evolution of Urbit's app space, few (none?) of this base layer of apps have yet been built.

One such base app is a run/walk/bike tracker, which records a user's outdoor activity (or simulated outdoor activity like treadmills, stationary bikes, etc.). An effective tracker will require GPS input that can be obtained with a phone and smart watch, among other devices. It should also provide statistics such as time, distance, and speed. Users should be able to track their progress by following training programs that they create. But that is just the beginning. Using Urbit's identity system, exercise challenges can be created, activity results can be posted to groups, and training programs can be provided by personal trainers offering their services. There are so many possibilities for this in the future, especially when combined with data from the other apps.
